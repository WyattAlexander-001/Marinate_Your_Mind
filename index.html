        <h1>Marinating the Material</h1>
        <p>Welcome dear viewer, this is a simple single page website for the purpose of sharing my philosophy on studying. I dub my technique, “marinating the material.” I also share how I personally feel about other studying techniques. The term “marination” is a direct reference to one of my favorite meals, a nice marinated steak because all good things take <em>thyme</em>!</p>
        <img class="placeholder" alt="Placeholder: juicy marinated steak">

        <!-- Intro -->
        <p>The core idea is that you want to have your mind constantly surrounded, or “marinated in” with the material you want to learn...</p>

        <!-- === SECTION: WHY OTHER TECHNIQUES FAIL === -->

        <h2>Why I Don’t Like Other Techniques</h2>
        <p>I think I should start by explaining why I came up with this method...</p>

        <div class="essay">
            <p>It’s because I tried others, and hated them, or felt they were lacking. I feel like many popular forms of “studying” make the studying process about the activity rather than the material!</p>
            <p>This is simply wrong.</p>

        <h2>Flash Cards Are Awful</h2>

        <div class="essay">
            <p>Flashcards are the embodiment of this wrongness, especially when done in the traditional rote memorization style. You put your question on side A, the answer on side B, you shuffle the deck and start drawing cards one at a time and try to answer each until you’ve exhausted all the cards.</p>
            <p>Repeat usage of this barbaric technique eventually leads your brain to do automatic word association, and that gives the user the illusion of learning. How is it an illusion? Well, you see the flash card, “define recursion,” and the other side you’ve seen so many times you can just blurt it out in an instant. “It’s when a function calls itself until you reach a base case.” But you didn’t write a recursive function, you don’t know a use case of it, and you don’t know where these are implemented, you just know a factoid and will now move on to an exam where you need to write that! It’s surface level and you’d be better off writing your own functions to see it in action.</p>

            <p>Well, you see the flash card, “define recursion,” and the answer side you’ve seen so many times you can just blurt it out in an instant. “It’s when a function calls itself until you reach a base case.,” you say in a zombified tone. But you didn’t write a recursive function, you didn’t state a use case of it, and you don’t know why you’d use this over a while or for loop, you just know a factoid and will now move on to an exam where you need to write one! It is surface level work, and you’d be better off writing your own functions to see it in action.</p>

        <h2>How Flash Cards "Can Work"</h2>

        <div class="essay">
            <p>This illusion is lessened in more advance forms of flash carding, but they still are games rather than true learning. Like Anki, a form of flash card studying where the user has a deck of flash cards and slowly creates piles based on their confidence. If you know the answer and proved it, then you put it in the green pile, if you feel 50/50 on the question, put it in the yellow pile, and if you’re 100% stumped, put it in the red pile.</p>
            <p>Anki is certainly useful for certain disciplines like learning a new language or memorizing drugs and their contraindications. I also have used Anki for interview questions to great success. But it falls into the habit of rote memorization for quick reward, and not long term success. After a month, that knowledge is flushed because it fails the core point of studying, learning.</p>
            <h2>Piles are Not How We Learn!</h2>
            <p>Now I get it, piles look cool! I do like the pile idea at first glance, and have used it early in my academic career, I even graduated to using the Leitner System for a time, which is moving flash cards into even more subdivided piles. However, inevitably, I fall out of a system when reality kicks in. </p>
            <p>Reality hits when you move onto a new thing to study and ask yourself a serious question. When will you ever return to this waste of paper or digital cards?</p>

        <h2>Your Brain is a Use It or Lose It System</h2>

            <p>Your mind, is a use it or lose it system. Like my old chemistry professor would say, you can’t just memorize, you must exercise!</p>
            <h3>You need to regularly do the thing you want to be good at.</h3>
            
            <p>To be a good boxer, you need to box! Boxing isn’t about reading flash cards. You need to punch! You need to spar! You need to do the activity to get better at the activity! </p>
            <p>Oh god it sounds so simple that it’s insulting to point it out! But news flash, most people ARE STUPID! <a href="https://medium.com/collapsenews/new-study-54-of-american-adults-read-below-6th-grade-levels-70031328fda9">Over 50% of Americans can only read at around 6th grade level</a>, and that’s because people don’t read anymore!</p>
