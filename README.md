# Marinate Your Mind

## Purpose:

This is a simple single page website for the purpose of sharing my philosophy on studying.

## TL;DR:

I dub my technique, “marinating.” Bascially, I want to have my mind constantly surrounded, or “marinated in” with the material I want to learn. 
Steps:
1. Get a couple videos as a primer or find a course and get a high level overview of the material.
2. Go over the official documentation,and really scribble all kinds of notes on that bad boy.
3. Apply Apply Apply! Do the thing!
4. Go back to step 1 and repeat.

## Script:

Welcome dear viewer, this is a simple single page website for the purpose of sharing my philosophy on studying. I dub my technique, “marinating.” I also share how I personally feel about other studying techniques. The term “marination” is a direct reference to one of my favorite meals, a nice marinated steak!

The core idea is that you want to have your mind constantly surrounded, or “marinated in” with the material you want to learn, and this method will work for any kind of material that you have interest in. Most of what I’m going to say is anecdotal, and this site is my own personal soap box, but I will add references later to bolster my arguments.

Why I don’t like other techniques.

I think I should start by explaining why I came up with this method, it’s because I tried others, and hated them, or felt them lacking. I feel like many popular forms of “studying” make the studying about the activity rather than the material. 

This is simply wrong.

Flashcards are the embodiment of this wrongness, especially when done in the traditional rote memorization style. You put your question on side A, the answer on side B, you shuffle the deck and start drawing cards one at a time and try to answer each until you’ve exhausted all the cards. 

Repeat usage of this barbaric technique eventually leads your brain to do automatic word association, and that gives the user the illusion of learning. How is it an illusion? Well, you see the flash card, “define recursion,” and the other side you’ve seen so many times you can just blurt it out in an instant. “It’s when a function calls itself until you reach a base case.” But you didn’t write a recursive function, you don’t know a use case of it, and you don’t know where these are implemented, you just know a factoid and will now move on to an exam where you need to write that! It’s surface level and you’d be better off writing your own functions to see it in action.

This illusion is lessened in more advance forms of flash carding, but they still are games rather than true learning. Like Anki, a form of flash card studying where the user has a deck of flash cards and slowly creates piles based on their confidence. If you know the answer and proved it, then you put it in the green pile, if you feel 50/50 on the question, put it in the yellow pile, and if you’re 100% stumped, put it in the red pile.  

Anki is certainly useful for certain disciplines like learning a new language or memorizing drugs and their contraindications. I also have used Anki for interview questions to great success. But it falls into the habit of rote memorization for quick reward and not long term success. After a month, that knowledge is flushed because it fails the core point of studying, learning.

Piles are not how we learn! I get it, in-fact I do like the pile idea at first glance, and have used it early in my academic career, I even graduated to using the Leitner System for a time, which is moving flash cards into even more subdivided piles. However, inevitably, I fall out of a system when reality kicks in. When will you ever return to this waste of paper or digital cards? Likely never! Your mind, is a use it or lose it system. Like my old chemistry professor would say, you can’t just memorize, you must exercise!  You need to regularly do the thing you want to be good at.

To be a good boxer, you need to box! Boxing isn’t about reading flash cards and creating silly systems of piles about your arbitrary confidence in boxing. You need to punch! You need to spar! You need to do the activity to get better at the activity! Oh god it sounds so simple that it’s stupid to point it out! But news flash, most people ARE STUPID! 60% of Americans can only read at a 6th grade level, and that’s because people don’t read anymore!

Listen, any reasonable thinking person knows the importance of deliberate practice. Any athlete knows this. Yes theory is important, but you only need to know enough to get started, then get your hands dirty, and then dive into theory for refinement. For example, it’s useful to know that a short uppercut is useful for when an opponent tries to get in too close to throw hooks. It’s another thing, to do it!

My method is simple:

Get a couple videos as a primer for what you want to know. Try to find someone reputable, check comments or reviews online. Just don’t do reputable full courses. I cannot stand udemy courses or 80hr tutorials as they encourage zombie follow along behavior where you don’t have time to practice. If you feel so compelled to do a course, and some disciplines require a structured learning approach, please stick to it and try to do 10 examples for every new thing you learn.
Go over the official documentation, anything worth learning is likely formalized in a nice text, find it online (pdf) or get  a good book. I personally love “destroying my books.” I use a red pen and do what is called marginalia, I act like a critic and comment on the margins on all of my books. It’s my book after all! No one will care if it’s covered in red ink. If I’m writing in my pdfs or books, I’m actively engaging with the text. But this is still not doing! But it is close! 

A note on highlighting, it is only useful when you comment next to it! It’s only for cleanliness instead of having a steady hand to underline with your red pen.

Apply Apply Apply! 

Do the thing finally! If you watched a video on how to make a pizza, and read a recipe book on pizza and taken your notes, it’s time to make the pizza! That example might seem childish and easy, but it really works. For math do the practice problems and find more online, for coding make some functions, for gardening go and get your hands dirty! Do the work!

Repeat from step 1. Oh I sure do love recursion! 

Going back to square one should be a familiar feeling, it’s like playing a game on new game+. For example, referring back to your old videos, you may have missed something, maybe with your new insights you now know a better way than the author and can leave a helpful comment. As for going over your text, maybe you now have a more concrete understanding of those best practices they were mentioning, and now you’re ready to getting back to applying! This is how you attain mastery! Embrace failure, get all of the mistakes out of you, and you will learn.

Eventually doing these four steps is how you attain automaticity, that is when you’re ability to study becomes as natural as breathing. This, simply put, works, you need to embrace the stuff you want to learn as part of who you are. And to do that is simply marinating it in your brain by constantly surrounding yourself with it. This process annoys many students because it is the medicine your parents and teachers have told you since forever. Do the work your work early, and do it a lot!

Bruce Lee has a great quote about time and commitment. He doesn’t fear the man who studied 1000 kicks once, he fears the man who studied 1 kicked and practiced it 1000 times!  

Why Craming Sucks:

It just sucks, because you’re not learning, you’re not building knowledge, you’re shoving a bunch of facts in your temporary storage in your brain which will be flushed away upon your next nap. You are literally wasting your time, you are just getting a bad nights rest, and damaging your physical and mental health by doing this. The sickening part is that many self-admitted crammers know this is stupid, but continue to do it regardless, because there’s a “culture” around cramming. 

They give it the ole “college try,” but college is for adults, and adults are supposed to be professional, and professionals don’t cram. You just lack discipline, or have an addiction to fun, or have undiagnosed ADHD. No shame in any of that, just troubleshoot your issues and fix them!

This may hit a nerve, but you are most likely lazy. This is normal, and we are all guilty of it. We all want to play instead of work. But there’s a balance between play and work. Like President Teddy Roosevelt said, if you’re going to play, play hard, and if you’re going to work, work hard. It really is that simple.

People all over the world look for self-help books to get them motivated because they lack discipline. Many people believe this magical book will make them more productive, or be optimal in their path in life. 

They are all snake oil garbage, you know what 99% of those self-help books are gonna say? They’re going make you feel better about yourself by blaming everyone and everything thing but you. They will blame ai, blame social media, blame video games, movies, drugs, your friends, music, politicians, your parents, and a whole host of cold reads that eventually one will resonate with you. It’s the shotgun approach of emotional manipulation. Simply rattle off a list of things normal people face and if two or three resonate with you, you’re hooked.

Well don’t worry, I’ll blame you, and only you. Because who is responsible for you? YOU! You are responsible for you! You can blame everyone and everything about your situation, or you can learn to fix things.


As a guy, when I have an issue, my brain just goes into, “fix it” mode. I can’t help myself, I see a leak somewhere I need to fix it, I see something repetitive I want to automate it, I see something wrong I say something. It’s part of my personality, and I want that to be part of your personality. 

Everyone, and I mean everyone should have a nagging voice in their head that tells them to fix something. It’s called a conscience. That little cricket in your chest that compels you to do the right thing even though it’s hard.

Did you study enough for that exam? Did you unit test your code? Did you do your daily 25 pages of reading? Did you hit the gym? It’s all about discipline! 

You don’t need to be “motivated” to do work! You just do work. People go to work on farms picking fruit in 90-degree weather, getting sunburnt and heat stroke, being paid pennies on the dollar, and you can’t pick up a textbook for 30 minutes? 

When you need to get stuff done, you do it regardless of how you feel. Eventually it becomes routine. You become what you do, and if you, “choose to do” you will become a do-er. I saved you so many self-help books and a lot of money by telling you this. Rip the band-aide off, and come back to reality, work is boring, but progress is progress, and progress is good! 

Discipline literally means to train or be trained, so it always annoyed me when people say they lack discipline. What they’re really saying is they’re never in the mood to learn, to put in the effort. Now, I’m gonna act like some out of touch Republican telling you that this new generation is lazy. Everything is case by case, but one thing I’ve noticed across all of humanity, is a lack of desire to learn. 

You should adopt a love of learning, and some people are born with that trait, usually in the form of ADHD where you need constant novelty, and some get it once they find the thing that makes them happy. 

I think society really pushes people into believing you need to be highly motivated all the time and do what you love so you can be disciplined. But I don’t think that’s the case, it’s all unrelated. Some of the most fun jobs in the world become routine and boring, but at the end of the day you still have to show up and do your job. Actors, Game Devs, Astronauts, Musicians, Porn Stars, Pro-Wrestlers, Inventors, Lawyers, Surgeons, and Photographers all have extremely fun jobs that are fulfilling, but even they will all say that work is work. 

Everyone who has a fun job, or an unfun job would rather just take a mid-day nap, eat some pizza, and watch some garbage reality TV about stupid angry racist people. We are human after all. So how do people do the work? By doing it. So do it!

My method, is what works for me, and I found that it works for me after a bunch of trial and error, and harsh self-reflection. I have ADHD, I need constant novelty, and since I’m a millennial I was the first wave of a generation raised on: advertisements, big data, anime, video games, cell phones, celebrity worship, internet, all powered by PhD researchers who specialize in addiction along with an army of marketing agents and data analysts. 

We were given Pokemon growing up, our minds didn’t stand a chance! I really feel bad for the kids growing up with Ipads and Cocomelon. If a 40 year old alcoholic with liver cirrhosis can’t kick and addictions how can a 3 year old toddler kick an addiction? 

So how do you go from playing games all the time to actually doing work? Well it’s slow but gradual. I went from studying for 30 mins at a given time, and then playing Dark Souls for an hour 1, and alternating that for the whole day. Eventually I leveled up to studying for an hour and playing Dark Souls for an hour. Wait what?

Yeah that’s the secret, I guess I should mention my ability to be interested in my work has gone to a record 4 hours of focus on a given topic, but you see, I didn’t actually beat my addiction to games. I just changed my addiction to getting stuff solved.  

I just increased my time studying and still marinated the material in my brain for 8 hours a day. In an 8 hour cycle, whether I play 1 hr on and off, or 2hrs on studying and 1 hr gaming, or 3 hours studying and 5 hours gaming, I’m still making progress as the material is marinating. Even when I game I periodically look back on my work. Maybe stop and do a little more here and there. I made my environment about the stuffy I enjoy, and studying is something I enjoy. My grades speak for themselves, I graduated from college Magnum Cum Laude with a Bachelor’s in Science in Computer Science. That means I took ALL the computer science class I could, and still left with a nice 3.72 GPA. I could have played less games, but overall I still exposed myself to the material and let it soak.  

The minimum number of time to study anything is 100 minutes, so if I’m putting in at least two hours of effort into something, I know I’m making slow and steady progress. 

How do I know its 100 minutes? Well, a lady by the name of Barbara Oakley had a famous Ted Talk, that engineers love to cite, it’s about retraining your brain. To apply the method I have described, please watch the video and come back

Ok, you’re back, now I want you to read her Wikipedia article and jot down some notes on your screen using this chrome extension to have sticky notes on your screen:

Now go apply that knowledge somehow and comeback, do the Pomodoro technique as described in the video to study something of interest for you! 

Ok I know you’re not going to apply the knowledge… 

Because you want to finish my ramblings! 

Thank you! 

But do you see what I mean? How easy it is? Her video is genius, it’s the basis of the Pomodoro technique, focus on something for 25 mins, take a 5 minute break to relax and let your brain marinade the new material, and boom progress! 

Keep doing it over and over and eventually you learn. But I’m lazy, and chances are, so are you! 

I just study for an hour at a relaxed pace, then game for an hour where I think about what I learned and check back at my notes I made in the study window. It works for me! It’s a dirty Pomodoro!

And I don’t need to study for only 100 minutes, remember, a 100 minutes is only 1hr 40 mins! 

I can study ALL DAY EVERY DAY every day with my technique. It looks lazier, and it certainly is! But I prefer it. You see, when I started I could barely focus for 20 mins, I did the pomodoro a bunch until I could get to a full hour, and I legit took only the 5 minute breaks. Then I kinda just kept going, I could study for 4 hours straight, and that isn’t surprising, I’ve played games for hours on end without stopping.

But reality kicked in again! I went back to playing games, and not using the Pomodoro method, but here’s the thing. It wasn’t a waste of time. I built a muscle for long term studying. This is a gift, and I should not squander it. So if I have to get work done, get the work done first, do it for at least a solid hour, work your way up with the good ole Pomodoro, and remember to tell yourself, “why do later when you can do it now?” You are an adult, look at the clock, and earnestly get yourself to do your studying, watch your videos, take your notes, and then get your hands dirty, and when you feel like you’ve made good progress and want to veg out playing a game, go for it, but then have that nagging feeling of wanting to make more progress in your studies. Look back at your notes every now and again, make your work important and incorporate into what you do. Talk to yourself about what you learned as you play, anything to keep the ball rolling.

That’s it; it’s no big secret, no fancy tricks. Just spending time with the material, doing the work as you’re supposed to. The only way forward is one step at a time. Yes I study way less than some of my over achiever friends who only study because that is who they are, but I’m certainly better than those who cram and know nothing!

The main lesson I wanted to teach here is just marinade the material, you will make slow and steady progress, and maybe you’ll learn to make it important in your life. Spend time with it, go over it again and again in different ways, talk to yourself, teach others, and make it a part of who you are. Those who fully adopt this style become experts in their field because they get a love of their craft by sheer time spent on it, and that’s why it is so important to find your passion! I couldn’t imagine learning to code just for money, find something you like, or at least tolerable and marinade that steak.
